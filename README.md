ReCyclr is an interactive functional prototype designed to help residents find household waste recycling centers in Avonmouth. 
It has static web-pages that run in the browser, created using HTML and CSS. 
It is clickable/navigable, but as a prototype, it is not fully functional.
Embedded iframes from Open Data Bristol were used for tables and maps.
